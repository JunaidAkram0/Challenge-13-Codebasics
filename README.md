üöñ Challenge #13: Insights for Chief of Operations in the Transportation Domain

I‚Äôm excited to share that I‚Äôve completed the SQL portion of the Goodcabs Challenge, where I analyzed critical metrics to support data-driven decisions for optimizing operations in tier-2 cities across India.

üí° Key SQL Functions & Concepts I Learned:
Through this project, I mastered a variety of SQL functions and techniques, including:

Aggregate Functions: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX() for summarizing data.
Window Functions:
ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK() for ranking data.
PARTITION BY for segmenting data analysis.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Using WITH to structure queries and improve readability.
Joins: Inner, Left, and Cross Joins to merge tables effectively.
Subqueries: Nesting queries for complex operations.
Conditional Logic: CASE statements for dynamic categorization.
Date and Time Functions: Extracting, grouping, and analyzing temporal data.
Mathematical Functions: ROUND() for precision and clarity in metrics.
Percent Calculations: Understanding contributions, differences, and rates.
üìä Business Requests Addressed:
1Ô∏è‚É£ City-Level Fare and Trip Summary: Average fares, city contribution to trips, and more.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Monthly City-Level Trip Target Analysis: Evaluating trip performance against targets.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Repeat Passenger Distribution: Insights into passenger retention by city and trip frequency.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Cities with Highest/Lowest New Passengers: Identifying growth opportunities.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue Contribution: Highlighting months with the highest revenue for each city.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Repeat Passenger Rate Analysis: Measuring passenger retention across months and cities.

‚ú® Next Steps:
I‚Äôm moving forward with creating dashboards and a compelling presentation to share these insights with business stakeholders.

üí¨ Reflections:
This project challenged me to think strategically about transportation data and deliver actionable insights. It‚Äôs been a rewarding experience, and I‚Äôm eager to see how this impacts decision-making at Goodcabs.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to collaborate or have feedback on my work!
